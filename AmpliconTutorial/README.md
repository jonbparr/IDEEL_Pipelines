# Amplicon Tutorial for IDEElers

Briefly, amplicons are specific regions in the genome of interest -- commonly called targets. Amplicon Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) can be performed on a single target (i.e. single amplicon sequencing) or on multiple targets from the same sample (multiplex amplicon sequencing). Several strategies have been developed by IDEELers to deal with this approach; however, the best is **SeekDeep** by Nicholas J. Hathaway from University of Massachusetts Medical School. This tutorial will provide an overview of resources to learn command line, basic genomic file types, basic alignment pipelines, and most importantly, **SeekDeep**.
